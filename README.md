# IOC
so what is IOC Container?
as mentioned in WikiPedia, In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. IoC inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.

but before finding out what IOC Container is we should talk about dependency injection.<br />
so what is dependency injection? Dependency injection is a procedure where one object supplies the dependencies of another object.<br /> Dependency Injection is a software design approach that allows avoiding hard-coding dependencies and makes it possible to change the dependencies both at runtime and compile time.
